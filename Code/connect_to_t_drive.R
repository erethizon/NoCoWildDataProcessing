df<-read.csv("/Volumes/classes/Bart_s04/Research_group/NoCoWild/Data/exif_metadata/myoutput.csv")

# The file path may be different if you ware working on a different computer. To determine the correct file path, use the terminal and the cd command (change directory) and then drop the exif_metadata folder on the terminal line. When it changes the directory, it will show the full path to that folder.
