choose_my_classification_file<-function(classification_file_path){

  class_files<-list.files(classification_file_path)

  #now ask user which file to use
  my_selection<- menu(class_files,
                      title= "Which classification file do you want?")
  #now save the user's choice
  my_selection<-class_files[my_selection]

  #now read in the selected file
  jdata<-read.csv(paste0(classification_file_path,"/",my_selection ),stringsAsFactors = F)
  out<-list(my_selection, jdata)
  return(out)
