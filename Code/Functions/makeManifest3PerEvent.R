#This is the function that takes the output of assignEvents and organizes it into the "manifest" file required for uploading photos to the zooniverse. It creates a dataframe (Manifest) to receive data and then loops through the images_by_event file, assigning images to the proper column based on their event membership. Next it adds data to the manifest (the DateTimeOriginal of each event, the Camera, SD card number and the Event id) to save steps in the future when processing classification files received from the Zooniverse.

#The argument that is passed to the function is the dataframe that was created by the assignEvents function.The function returns a dataframe that can be exported as the manifest file for this set of images. Any additional data (Site, Round number, or any other fields we wish to add prior to classification) can be added in Excel prior to uploading.
