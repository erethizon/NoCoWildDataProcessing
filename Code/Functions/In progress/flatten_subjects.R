#this function takes the subject_data column from our zooniverse data (the column that includes the information from the manifest file) and flattens it into a separate column for each json element.

#For each row of data, the first part of the subject_data json is the number that corresponds to the subject id.  Because each subject id is unique, if you try to parse these data as is, you will get a new column for every single subject, which is insane.  To solve this problem, we're going to replace the subject_id in the subject_data column with uniform text.

DF$new_sub_data<-DF$subject_data %>% str_replace(subj_id_string, "subject") #replace the strings with the word "subject"

#Now we can parse. This code may have to be updated to match any changes in the subject data structure in future.
