# NoCoWildDataProcessing

## Introduction
This is the repo that hosts the R project in which my students and I process and analyze game camera images for the [North Country Wild](https://www.natureupnorth.org/north-country-wild) community science project.

The project is organized with three subdirectories:  
  - Code  
  - Data  
  - Output
